       <p> India is gearing up to celebrate its 75 years of Independence (76th Independence Day) from British rule on August 15, Monday. India achieved its Independence from British colonial rule on August 15, 1947. The struggle for freedom was a long and tiresome one; witnessing the sacrifices of many freedom fighters, who laid down their lives for their country and fellow citizens. This day honours our freedom fighters, the history of our country, its culture, and the nation's achievements as a whole. It also reminds every Indian citizen about the dawn of a new beginning of an era of deliverance from the clutches of British colonialism for more than 200 years.</p>
